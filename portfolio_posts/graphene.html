    Graphene is a two dimensional hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms which has the properties that the energy band structure is linear rather than parabolic at low energies and is a zero-gap semiconductor. These two properties lead to a resistivity versus gate voltage curve that exhibits a sharp peak for undoped graphene at zero gate voltage (\(V_G\)) that then slopes down towards zero as \(V_G\) increases/decreases.
</p> 
</p> 
To experimentally verify this behavior, we fabricated a graphene field effect transistor (FET) and measured the resistivity of the graphene channel as a function of the gate voltage. We fabricated two graphene FETs and performed back gate resistivity measurements and found that for one sample (3A) that there may be a resistivity dependence on \(V_G\) that weakly agrees with the expected behavior although curve appears to be broadened and our data is overall noisy. We then discuss the possible reasons: gate leakage in our samples, non ideal graphene samples,
