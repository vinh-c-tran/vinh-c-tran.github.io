    Graphene is a two dimensional hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms which has the properties that the energy band structure is linear rather than parabolic at low energies and is a zero-gap semiconductor. These two properties lead to a resistivity versus gate voltage curve that exhibits a sharp peak for undoped graphene at zero gate voltage (\(V_G\)) that then slopes down towards zero as \(V_G\) increases/decreases.
</p> 
</p> 
To experimentally verify this behavior, we fabricated a graphene field effect transistor (FET) and measured the resistivity of the graphene channel as a function of the gate voltage. We fabricated two graphene FETs and performed back gate resistivity measurements and found that for one sample (3A) that there may be a resistivity dependence on \(V_G\) that weakly agrees with the expected behavior although curve appears to be broadened and our data is overall noisy. We then discuss the possible reasons: gate leakage in our samples, non ideal graphene samples,

            Proper monolayer graphene is a two dimensional, single layer of hexagonal honeycomb arrangement of carbon atoms. Due to this structure, graphene has some significant electronic properties such as high electron mobility on the order of 15,000 cm\(^2\)/Vs. Additionally, graphene is a semiconductor with zero-gap between the valence and conduction band (which in this case would make it more like a metal).

            The energy-momentum dispersion relation takes the linear form
            $$
                E = \hbar k c_* \qquad c_* \approx 10^6\text{m/s}
            $$
            akin to the dispersion relation for relativistic massless particles like photons for low energies near the Dirac points, the points where the valence and conduction bands meet. We can see that the typical parabolic bands are to first order replaced by linear cones, illustrating the linear energy-momentum dispersion relation.

            Likewise for low energies, from the linear energy momentum dispersion relation, the density of states as a function of energy is given approximately by \(\rho(E) \propto |E|\) <!--\cite{Novoselov}-->. Since the number density of carriers is given by
            $$
                n = \int_{-\infty}^E \rho(E)F(E)\,dE
            $$
            where \(\rho\) is the density of states and \(F(E)\) is the Fermi-Dirac distribution, as the Fermi energy sweeps through the conduction and valence bands, the cone shapes indicate that the number of charge carriers (holes for the valence band and electrons for the conduction band) will decrease as the Fermi energy approaches the Dirac points and increase as it moves further away.

        Our goal was to measure the resistivity of the graphene FET as a function of applied gate voltage.
