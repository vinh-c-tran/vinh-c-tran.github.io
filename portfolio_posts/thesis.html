    Neutron stars, remnants of supernovae of supermassive stars, are some of the densest objects in the universe! Some pretty novel physics occurs when things get so dense which leads to some remaining unanswered questions about these things. One of the main problems is that of mass-radius relations. Another though is that of the state of matter inside of neutron star cores. 
</p>
<h4>
    Core Composition Problem 
</h4>
</p> 
    It's commonly accepted that towards the surface of the star that matter exists in the form of free neutrons, protons and electrons all existing in chemical equilibrium (this is called beta equilibrium!). However, as we go deeper into the core of the star and density and pressure rises, it is possible for matter to transition to different phases. One of the first things that could happen is the introduction of new particles such as heavier baryons like Hyperons.

<h2>
    Stellar Oscillations
</h2>
<p>
    One possible approach to this problem is to rely on the frequency spectra of stellar oscillations. Stellar oscillations and stellarseismology as a whole mirror geoseismology in the idea that through earthquakes (or in this case starquakes), we can learn more about the internal structure of the object! 
</p> 

<p>
    In particular, we can write down a series of equations that model how the star, or more precisely, a fluid element of the star, will oscillate in time when displaced from its equilibrium position. The equations are derived from general relativity. These are usually too hard for us to solve fully, so we use the familiar trick of physicists! We introduce a set of quantities: the perturbed quantities and Taylor expand to first order about the equilibrium position. Then these give us a "linearized" set of equations to solve which yield the oscillatory equations of motion for different quantities, one of which being \(\xi\) which describes the perturbed position of a fluid parcel. 
</p> 
<p> 
    Different modes of oscillation due to different restorative forces and different symmetries will yield different equations of motion. One example, the g-mode, has the following coupled set of  differential equations for the different perturbed quantities. 
    $$
    \begin{align}
        - \frac{1}{e^{\lambda/2}r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} 
        [e^{\lambda/2} r^2 \xi_r] 
        + \frac{\ell(\ell + 1)e^\nu}{r^2\omega^2} \frac{\delta p}{p + \epsilon} - \frac{\Delta p}{\gamma p} &= 0\\
    \frac{\partial \delta p}{\partial r} + g\left(1 + \frac{1}{c_s^2}\right)\delta p 
        + e^{\lambda - \nu}h(N^2 - \omega^2)\xi_r &= 0 
    \end{align}
    $$

        G-Modes and Sound Speed Differences
    </h2>
    <p>
        There is one specific mode of oscillation, the g-mode, which has buoyancy as its restorative force that seems especially well suited towards addressing the composition problem. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In particular, the g-mode's oscillation is directly proportional to a characteristic frequency called the  Brunt-Vaisala frequency \(N\). This frequency, given below, is dependent on the difference (of the reciprocals) of two different sound speeds
        $$
            N^2 := g^2\left(\frac{1}{c_e^2} - \frac{1}{c_s^2}\right) e^{\nu-\lambda}
        $$
        where
        $$
            c_e^2 := \frac{dp}{d\epsilon} \qquad c_s^2 := 
            \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \epsilon}\right)\bigg|_x
        $$
        as defined are the equilibrium and adiabatic sound speed respectively. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The adiabatic sound speed in particular is defined as the partial derivative of the pressure with respect to energy density while keeping the various particle fractions fixed, or in other words, fixing the composition. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, it is imperative to be able to calculate the difference between the two sound speeds and is a large focus of this project. 
    </p>
</div>

<div id = "Sound Speed Difference Methods">
</div>
    <h2> Sound Speed Difference Methods </h2>
    <p>
        From the definition of the two sound speeds in terms of derivatives of pressure with respect to energy density, it is possible to then re-write this sound speed difference in terms of different expressions that may be more amenable to calculations.

<div id = "Relativistic Mean Field Model">
    <h2>
        Relativistic Mean Field Model
    </h2>
    <p>
        To make numerical progress, we need to actually specify a particular model or framework (which describes how the particles interact with one another) in which to work. Some popular ones include: MIT Bag models, NJL Models, or the one we use here in this thesis, a Walecka type relativistic mean field (RMF) model. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In this sort of model, an effective quantum field theory model, baryons such as nucleons and hyperons interact via different meson carriers. The interacting part of the Lagrangian describing these sort of interactions can take the following form (many other Lagrangians in this sort of model exist!)
        $$
            \mathcal{L}_\text{int} = \sum_{B} \bar{\psi}_B 
            \left[g_\sigma \sigma - g_\omega \gamma^\mu \omega_\mu - \frac{1}{2}g_\rho \gamma^\mu \vec{\tau} \vec{\rho}_\mu \right] \psi_B
            - \frac{1}{2} bm(g_\sigma\sigma)^3 - \frac{1}{4}c(g_\sigma \sigma)^4 
        $$
        where of note are the meson fields: \(\sigma, \rho, \omega\) and the coupling constants \(g_\sigma, g_\omega, g_\rho\) which are what describes how the baryons and mesons couple to one another. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It's from this Lagrangian (and the free part) that we can apply the Euler-Lagrange equations to get the equations of motion for the various particle fields. But as we can see, we end up getting equations of motion that are highly nonlinear! And coupled! So it becomes quite a nightmare to deal with. But alas! We usually don't need to deal with the equations in this form. When we're interested in stars, we're interested in a system at equilibrium in its ground state which allows us to apply a simplifying approximation: the mean field approximation. The meson fields don't vary much in time or space in equilibrium so we can ignore their time and spatial variations (ie, derivative terms with respect to \(t,\vec{r}\))

    <h2>
        Python: Data Generation and Numerical Non-Linear Solver
    </h2>
    <p>
        To make any progress, we need to start off by solving for the various values of the different particle momentas and field values as a function of baryon density \( n_B \). Each point \( n_B \) then traces out a trajectory in phase space that uniquely defines values for the meson fields, baryon and lepton momenta and fraction. To do this though, we need to solve our system of equations in the context of an RMF model. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We are left with a system of <i>n</i> highly nonlinear and coupled equations and <i>n</i> unknown variables. In other words, we have a multivariate optimization problem. We can approach this using a Quasi-Newton method called Broyden's method. The structure and tasks are as follows
     </p>
     <ol>
        <li>
            First, from a defined system of particles (ie, specify the exact species of nucleons, hyperons, leptons, and mesons) that we want present, generate the RMF equations of motion. For the sake of verification that the equations are correct, we do this symbolically in <code> Sympy </code>. 
            
            <ul><li>There is one small subtlety: not all of the species will be present "at the beginning" when the total baryon density \(n_B\) is small, so we need to check whether or not the conditions for another heavier particle to enter the picture is satisfied or not. This is the threshold condition and is given by \(\mu_n + q_B \mu_e \geq m_B^*\)</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Solve the system of non-linear equations using a Broyden's method that interfaces with the symbolic sympy expressions.

        Particle Classes
     </h4>
     <p>
         Due to the nature of our project, we are dealing with particles. Each particle has a mass, a charge, an isospin, a Fermi momenta, a fraction, etc and etc. To manage these attributes in an organized way that allows for generalizing to systems of different composition, we define various particle classes. For example, we have a <code> Baryon </code> class specified as follows
     </p>

     <pre>
         <code>
        class baryon:
            # baryon class, stores both symbolic and numeric values in a single class 
            # baryon particle 
            def __init__(self, name, spin, isospin, charge, kind, var_type,\
                sym_mass, sym_mass_eff, sym_density, sym_frac, sym_kf, sym_ef, sym_chem_pot,\
                num_mass = 0.0, num_mass_eff = 0.0, num_density = 0.0, num_frac = 0.0,\
                num_kf = 0.0, num_ef = 0.0, num_chem_pot = 0.0):

        # variables common to both classes
        self.name = name
        self.kind = kind
        self.var_type = var_type
        self.charge = charge
        self.spin = spin
        self.isospin = isospin
        self.type = 'Baryon'

        self.num_kf = num_kf
        self.num_ef = num_ef

         Generating the various important quantities
     </h4>
     <p>
         Next, we would need a few functions that take these objects and generate/calculate a few important quantities that ultimately lead to the equations of motion. In particular, we write functions that generate quantities such as the vector and scalar densities \(n_s^i\) defined as 
         $$
            n^s_i = \frac{m_i^*}{2\pi} \left[k_{F_i}E_{F_i} - {m_i^*}^2\ln \frac{k_{F_i} + E_{F_i}^*}{m_i^*}\right] 
         $$
         or the mesonic equations of motion such as 
         $$
            m_\sigma^2 \sigma + \frac{\partial U}{\partial \sigma} = \sum_i g_{\sigma i} n_i^s 
         $$
     </p>
     <pre>
         <code>
            def scalar_density(baryon):
            """ returns scalar density n_s for a given baryon
                note: we modify the argument of the natural log as to be positive definite to avoid complex numbers 
                this is a symbolic expression (sympy)
            """ 
            coeff_1 = (2*baryon.spin + 1)/(2*Pi**2)
            coeff_2 = baryon.sym_mass_eff
            term_2 = baryon.sym_ef*baryon.sym_kf 
            term_2_2 = sym.sqrt(((baryon.sym_ef + baryon.sym_kf)/baryon.sym_mass_eff)**2)
            term_3 = sym.log(term_2_2)
            
            return coeff_1*coeff_2*(term_2 - baryon.sym_mass_eff**2*term_3)/2
         </code>
     </pre>
     <p>
         We also have other equations to consider in our system of equations which take the form of constraints such as charge neutrality, baryon number conservation, and beta equilibrium conditions (on chemical potentials). 
         
         <ol>
             <li>In particular though, we write them as take advantage of each particles' relevant attributes to generate this condition from just a list of particles, rather than hard code this in for each specific case.</li>
             <li>
                 For example, each particle has a <code>particle.charge</code> attribute. Charge neutrality requires that the number of positively charged particles is equal to the number of negatively charged particles. Mathematically, this is written as 
                 $$
                    \sum_i q_i n_i = 0 \qquad i \in \text{all particles}
                 $$
                 So from a list of particles in our active system, using particle objects and classes, we could simply loop over and just extract each particle's charge attribiute which makes for easier and cleaner code. 
             </li>
        </ol>  
     </p>

        Data Parsing

    <p>
        One last task to do is that of data storage. Our aim to recap is to calculate field values and momenta all as a function of baryon density \(n_B\). Then a natural object would be a two-dimensional array or matrix where each row will correspond to all the relevant values for a given specific \(n_B\).
