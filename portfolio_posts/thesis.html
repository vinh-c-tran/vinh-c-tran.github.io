    Neutron stars, remnants of supernovae of supermassive stars, are some of the densest objects in the universe! Some pretty novel physics occurs when things get so dense which leads to some remaining unanswered questions about these things. One of the main problems is that of mass-radius relations. Another though is that of the state of matter inside of neutron star cores.

<h4>
    Core Composition Problem 
</h4>
</p> 
    It's commonly accepted that towards the surface of the star that matter exists in the form of free neutrons, protons and electrons all existing in chemical equilibrium (this is called beta equilibrium!). However, as we go deeper into the core of the star and density and pressure rises, it is possible for matter to transition to different phases. One of the first things that could happen is the introduction of new particles such as heavier baryons like Hyperons.

    One possible approach to this problem is to rely on the frequency spectra of stellar oscillations. Stellar oscillations and stellarseismology as a whole mirror geoseismology in the idea that through earthquakes (or in this case starquakes), we can learn more about the internal structure of the object!

    In particular, we can write down a series of equations that model how the star, or more precisely, a fluid element of the star, will oscillate in time when displaced from its equilibrium position. The equations are derived from general relativity. These are usually too hard for us to solve fully, so we use the familiar trick of physicists! We introduce a set of quantities: the perturbed quantities and Taylor expand to first order about the equilibrium position. Then these give us a "linearized" set of equations to solve which yield the oscillatory equations of motion for $\xi$ which describes the perturbed position of a fluid parcel.

        To make any progress, we need to start off by solving for the various values of the different particle momentas and field values as a function of baryon density \( n_B \). Each point \( n_B \) then traces out a trajectory in phase space that uniquely defines values for the meson fields, baryon and lepton momenta and fraction. To do this though, we need to solve our system of equations in the context of an RMF model.

        We are left with a system of <i>n</i> highly nonlinear and coupled equations and <i>n</i> unknown variables. In other words, we have a multivariate optimization problem. We can approach this using a Quasi-Newton method called Broyden's method.
