    Neutron stars, remnants of supernovae of supermassive stars, are some of the densest objects in the universe! Some pretty novel physics occurs when things get so dense which leads to some remaining unanswered questions about these things. One of the main problems is that of mass-radius relations. Another though is that of the state of matter inside of neutron star cores.

<h4>
    Core Composition Problem 
</h4>
</p> 
    It's commonly accepted that towards the surface of the star that matter exists in the form of free neutrons, protons and electrons all existing in chemical equilibrium (this is called beta equilibrium!). However, as we go deeper into the core of the star and density and pressure rises, it is possible for matter to transition to different phases. One of the first things that could happen is the introduction of new particles such as heavier baryons like Hyperons.
